# Organization

## Org Basics

In Salesforce, an **Organization** (**Org**) refers to a **complete Salesforce environment**. An Org can be either a **production environment** or a **non-production environment**, and it includes its own **data, users, features, configurations, and customizations**.

Salesforce provides different types of Orgs, including:

- **Trailhead Playground**: Learning ENV.
- **Developer Edition**: Dev ENV.
- **Sandbox (Partial/Full Copy)**: Test ENV with production data.
- **Scratch Org**: Temporary ENV for DevOps.
- **Preview Sandbox**: Test upcoming releases in advance.
- **Production**: Production ENV.

## [Trailhead Playground](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/trailhead_playground_management)

### TP Basics

**Trailhead Playground** (**TP**) is a Salesforce-provided, **dedicated learning environment** designed for hands-on practice. 

- **Purpose**: Primarily used for Trailhead courses, challenges, and experiments.
- **Pre-configured**: Some components required by Trailhead courses are pre-installed.

- **Free**: Multiple TP instances can be created for free, with no time limits.

- Open the **Trailhead** website.
- Click the **profile icon** in the top-right corner.
- Select **Hands-On Orgs**.
- Click **Create Playground**.

### [Get TP Username and Password](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/trailhead_playground_management/get-your-trailhead-playground-username-and-password)

## Developer Edition

### DE Basics

**Developer Edition** (**DE**) is a Salesforce-provided,  **development environment** designed for developers. 

# Objects

## Objects Basics

In Salesforce, **Objects** are **database tables** that store specific types of data. Each object consists of **fields** (columns) and **records** (rows),

Salesforce supports various types of objects, including:

- **Standard Objects**
- **Custom Objects**
- **External Objects**
- **Platform Events**
- **BigObjects**

## Standard Objects

**Standard Objects** in Salesforce are pre-built, out-of-the-box objects to help manage common business processes. 

## Custom Objects

**Custom Objects** in Salesforce are user-defined objects created to store data that is specific to an organization's business needs. 

### Create a Custom Object

- Select an Org.
- **Setup** > **Object Manager**
- **Create** > **Custom Object**
    - For **Label**, enter `<label_name>`. Notice that the **Object Name** and **Record Name** fields auto-fill.
    - For **Plural Label**, enter `<label_names>`.
    - Select the checkbox **Launch New Custom Tab Wizard after saving this custom object**.
    - Leave the rest of the values as default and click **Save**.

- **New Custom Object Tab**
    - Click the **Tab Style** field and select a style you like.
    - Click **Next**, **Next**, and **Save**.


## [Object Relationships](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/data_modeling/object_relationships?trail_id=force_com_dev_beginner)

There are two main types of object relationships: **lookup** and **master-detail**.

### Lookup Relationship

A **Lookup Relationship** in Salesforce is a type of relationship where one object can be linked to another object, but it does not require the dependent object to be strictly tied to the primary object. 

Similar to a **foreign key**, it allows a non-strict relationship between objects. For example, a **Contact** can be related to an **Account**, but the **Contact** can still exist independently.

#### Create a Lookup Relationship

- Select an org and create a custom object.
- From **Setup**, go to **Object Manager** | **<object_name>**.
- In the sidebar, click **Fields & Relationships**. 
- Click **New** in the top right.
    - For **data type**, Choose **Lookup Relationship** and click **Next**.
    - For **Related To**, choose a right one, and click **Next**.
    - For **Field Name**, enter Contact, then click **Next**.
    - Click **Next**, **Next**, **Next**, and **Save**.

### Master-Detail Relationship

A **Master-Detail Relationship** in Salesforce is a type of relationship where one object (the **Master**) controls another object (the **Detail**). The **Detail** object is highly dependent on the **Master** object, and its existence is tied to the **Master**. If a **Master** record is deleted, the associated **Detail** records are also deleted automatically.

#### Create a Master-Detail Relationship

- Select an org.
- Create the 1st custom object **<1st_object_name>**.
    - Create a field.
    - Create a record.
- Create the 2nd custom object **<2nd_object_name>**.
- Create a **lookup relationship**.
- Create a **Master-Detail Relationship**.
    - From **Setup**, go to **Object Manager** | **<object_name>**.
    - In the sidebar, click **Fields & Relationships**. 
    - Click **New** in the top right.
    - For **data type**, Choose **Master-Detail Relationship** and click **Next**.
    - For **Related To**, choose **<1st_object_name>**, and click **Next**.
    - For Field Name, enter `Property` and click **Next**.
    - Click **Next**, **Next**, and **Save**.
- Contact **<2nd_object_name>** with **<1st_object_name>**.
    - From the **App Launcher** find and select **Sales**.
    - Click the **<1st_object_name>** tab in the navigation bar. 
    - Click **Related**. Youâ€™ll see **<2nd_object_name>** (0) in the Related tab.
    - Click **New**. Enter a name for **Favorite Name**, then click **Save**.

# Tabs

# Fields

## Fields Basics

In Salesforce, **Fields** (columns) are the individual pieces of data that make up a record in an object.  Each field represents a specific type of information, such as text, numbers, dates, or relationships with other objects. Fields are used to store and display data, and they define the structure of an object.

**Standard Fields**: These are pre-defined fields provided by Salesforce for standard objects like **Account**, **Contact**, and **Opportunity**. Examples include **Name**, **Created Date**, and **Phone**.

**Custom Fields**: Users can create custom fields for both standard and custom objects to capture specific information that the out-of-the-box fields do not cover.

In the **Field Name** column, for example, `Price__c`, the `__c` suffix is an easy way to identify a custom field.

## Create a Field

- Select an org and create a custom object.
- From **Setup**, go to **Object Manager** | **<object_name>**.
- In the sidebar, click **Fields & Relationships**. 
- Click **New** in the top right.
    - For **data type**, select the right one, Then click **Next**.
    - Fill out **Field Label** field, and **Field Name** field auto-fill.
    - Check the **Required** box.
    - Click **Next**, **Next** again, and then **Save**.
- Create Records
    - From the **App Launcher** find and select **Sales**.
    - Click the **<object_name>** tab in the navigation bar. 
    - Click **New** in the top corner.
    - Enter a name and price for the Object and click **Save**.

- **Toolbox (1)** : The toolbox lists the elements and resources youâ€™ve built in your flow. You can also create resources such as variables, formulas, and choices to use in your flow.
- **Canvas (2)** : The canvas is the working area.
- **Button Bar (3)**: Provide some tools.

## Building Blocks

- Flows use three building blocks: elements, connectors, and resources.

    <img src="assets/image-20250311221030163.png" alt="image-20250311221030163" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Each element is a step that tells the flow what to do, and each type of element does something different. 
- Think of flow elements as three types.
    - Interaction
    - Data
    - Logic

### Connectors

- **Connectors** are lines on the canvas that define the path the flow takes when it runs.

### Resources

- **Resources** are containers that donâ€™t appear on the canvas, but are referenced by the flowâ€™s elements. Each resource contains a value or a formula that resolves to a value.
