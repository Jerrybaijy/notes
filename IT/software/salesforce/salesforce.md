## Developer Edition

### DE Basics

**Developer Edition** (**DE**) is a Salesforce-provided,  **development environment** designed for developers. 

# Objects

## Objects Basics

In Salesforce, **Objects** are **database tables** that store specific types of data. Each object consists of **fields** (columns) and **records** (rows),

Salesforce supports various types of objects, including:

- **Standard Objects**
- **Custom Objects**
- **External Objects**
- **Platform Events**
- **BigObjects**

## Standard Objects

**Standard Objects** in Salesforce are pre-built, out-of-the-box objects to help manage common business processes. 

## Custom Objects

**Custom Objects** in Salesforce are user-defined objects created to store data that is specific to an organization's business needs. 

### Create a Custom Object

#### Custom Object

- Select an Org.
- **Setup** > **Object Manager** > **Create** > **Custom Object**
- For **Label**, enter `<label_name>`. Notice that the **Object Name** and **Record Name** fields auto-fill.
- For **Plural Label**, enter `<label_names>`.
- Select the checkbox **Launch New Custom Tab Wizard after saving this custom object**.
- Leave the rest of the values as default and click **Save**.
- **New Custom Object Tab**
    - Click the **Tab Style** field and select a style you like.
    - Click **Next**, **Next**, and **Save**.

#### Custom Object from Spreadsheet

- This's a sample in Trailhead: [Create a House Custom Object](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/get-started-with-salesforce-development/create-a-data-model-using-clicks?trail_id=force_com_dev_beginner)
- Download and open [this spreadsheet](https://developer.salesforce.com/files/House.csv) and save it as **House.csv**.
- **Setup** > **Object Manager** > **Create** > **Custom Object from Spreadsheet**
- Click **Login With Salesforce**.
- Login with your username and password of your **org**.
- Click **Allow**. Then upload the **House.csv** file you downloaded.
- Salesforce automatically detects the fields and populates all its record data.
- Choose **House Name** as the Record Name field in the top right.
- Click **Next** and enter the following settings.
    - Label: `House`

    - Plural Label: `Houses`
    - API Name: `House`
- Click **Finish**. The House object is successfully created and data imported, all within minutes.
- Check the new object in the **Object Manager**.
- Check the records:
    - Select **Houses** From **App Launcher**.
    - Click **Recently Viewed**, then select **All Records** to view all of the records in the House object.

- There're some other fertures in the Trailhead sample:
    -  [Data Security](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/data_security)
    - REST API
    - [Salesforce APIs Postman collection](https://github.com/forcedotcom/postman-salesforce-apis)
    - [Salesforce Mobile app](https://www.salesforce.com/solutions/mobile/overview/)

- To work with the **House** object you just created, you need to create an **App** to allow easy navigation.
    - Refer to the sample of Trailhead: [Create an App](#Create an App)

## [Object Relationships](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/data_modeling/object_relationships?trail_id=force_com_dev_beginner)

There are two main types of object relationships: **lookup** and **master-detail**.

### Lookup Relationship

A **Lookup Relationship** in Salesforce is a type of relationship where one object can be linked to another object, but it does not require the dependent object to be strictly tied to the primary object. 

Similar to a **foreign key**, it allows a non-strict relationship between objects. For example, a **Contact** can be related to an **Account**, but the **Contact** can still exist independently.

#### Create a Lookup Relationship

- Select an org and create a custom object.
- From **Setup**, go to **Object Manager** | **<object_name>**.
- In the sidebar, click **Fields & Relationships**. 
- Click **New** in the top right.
    - For **data type**, Choose **Lookup Relationship** and click **Next**.
    - For **Related To**, choose a right one, and click **Next**.
    - For **Field Name**, enter Contact, then click **Next**.
    - Click **Next**, **Next**, **Next**, and **Save**.

### Master-Detail Relationship

A **Master-Detail Relationship** in Salesforce is a type of relationship where one object (the **Master**) controls another object (the **Detail**). The **Detail** object is highly dependent on the **Master** object, and its existence is tied to the **Master**. If a **Master** record is deleted, the associated **Detail** records are also deleted automatically.

#### Create a Master-Detail Relationship

- Select an org.
- Create the 1st custom object **<1st_object_name>**.
    - Create a field.
    - Create a record.
- Create the 2nd custom object **<2nd_object_name>**.
- Create a **lookup relationship**.
- Create a **Master-Detail Relationship**.
    - From **Setup**, go to **Object Manager** | **<object_name>**.
    - In the sidebar, click **Fields & Relationships**. 
    - Click **New** in the top right.
    - For **data type**, Choose **Master-Detail Relationship** and click **Next**.
    - For **Related To**, choose **<1st_object_name>**, and click **Next**.
    - For Field Name, enter `Property` and click **Next**.
    - Click **Next**, **Next**, and **Save**.
- Contact **<2nd_object_name>** with **<1st_object_name>**.
    - From the **App Launcher** find and select **Sales**.
    - Click the **<1st_object_name>** tab in the navigation bar. 
    - Click **Related**. Youâ€™ll see **<2nd_object_name>** (0) in the Related tab.
    - Click **New**. Enter a name for **Favorite Name**, then click **Save**.

# Fields

## Fields Basics

**Fields** are columns in object database tables. There are **Standard Fields** and **Custom Fields**

**Standard Fields**: These are pre-defined fields provided by Salesforce for standard objects like **Account**, **Contact**, and **Opportunity**. Examples include **Name**, **Created Date**, and **Phone**.

**Custom Fields**: Users can create custom fields for both standard and custom objects to capture specific information that the out-of-the-box fields do not cover.

- **Field Name**: `Price__c`, the `__c` suffix is an easy way to identify a custom field.
- **Field Label**: The Field Label is what you see on the \<Object> page.

## Create a Field

- This's a sample in Trailhead: [Create a Field](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/starting_force_com/starting_intro?trail_id=force_com_dev_beginner)
- Install the APP **Dreamhouse**.
- From **Setup**, locate to **Object Manager** > **Contact**.
- In the sidebar, click **Fields & Relationships**. 
- Click **New** in the top right.
    - For **data type**, select **Checkbox** and click **Next**.
    - Type `Prequalified?` in the **Field Label** field, and **Field Name** field auto-fill.
    - Click **Next**, **Next** again to accept the default field-level security.
    - Check the checkboxes to add the new field to all the Contact Page Layouts.
    - Click **Save**.
- Check the new field:
    - Locate to **Dreamhouse** from **App Launcher**.
    - Click the **Contacts** tab, then click a contact name.
    - Under the **Details** tab, you can see your new field **Prequalified?**.


# Records

- This's a sample in Trailhead: [Build a Reusable UI Component with Lightning Web Components](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/get-started-with-salesforce-development/build-reusable-ui-component-with-lightning-web-components?trail_id=force_com_dev_beginner).
- This sample is based on the project **Dreamhouse**: [Create a New Salesforce Project](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/projects/get-started-with-salesforce-development/get-ready-to-develop?trail_id=force_com_dev_beginner).

### Create and Deploy a Lightning Web Component

- Under the **force-app/main/default** folder, right-click the **lwc** folder and select **SFDX: Create Lightning Web Component**.

- Name the Lightning web component `housingMap` and select the **main/default/lwc** directory.

- You see these files: an HTML file, a JavaScript file, a metadata XML file, and a test.js file.

    ![image-20250317022341519](assets/image-20250317022341519.png)

- In the HTML file, **housingMap.html**, copy and paste the following code.

    ```html
    <template>
      <lightning-card title="Housing Map">
        <!-- Explore all the base components via Base component library
        (https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/overview/components)-->
          <lightning-map map-markers={mapMarkers}> </lightning-map>
      </lightning-card>
    </template>
    ```

- In the JavaScript file, **housingMap.js**, copy and paste the following code.

    ```javascript
    import { LightningElement, wire } from "lwc";
    import getHouses from "@salesforce/apex/HouseService.getRecords";
    export default class HousingMap extends LightningElement {
        mapMarkers;
        error;
        @wire(getHouses)
        wiredHouses({ error, data }) {
            if (data) {
            console.log(data);
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Notice**: The Lightning web component invokes the Apex class **HouseService** you wrote in the previous section to fetch the data.

- Next, let's add code to transform the data as needed by the [lightning-map](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning-map/documentation) Base component. Replace the code with the following lines.

    ```javascript
    import { LightningElement, wire } from "lwc";
    import getHouses from "@salesforce/apex/HouseService.getRecords";
    export default class HousingMap extends LightningElement {
        mapMarkers;
        error;
        @wire(getHouses)
        wiredHouses({ error, data }) {
            if (data) {
             // Use JavaScript Map function to transform the Apex method response wired to the component into the format required by lightning-map
              this.mapMarkers = data.map((element) => {
                    return {
                        location: {
                            Street: element.Address__c,
                            City: element.City__c,
                            State: element.State__c
                        },
                        title: element.Name
                    };
                });
                this.error = undefined;
            } else if (error) {
                this.error = error;
                this.mapMarkers = undefined;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- In the XML file, **housingMap.js-meta.xml**, Replace the code with the following lines.

    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <LightningComponentBundle xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">
        <apiVersion>63.0</apiVersion>
        <isExposed>true</isExposed>
        <targets>
          <target>lightning__HomePage</target>
        </targets>
    </LightningComponentBundle>
    ```

- Right click and select **SFDX: Deploy This Source to Org**.
