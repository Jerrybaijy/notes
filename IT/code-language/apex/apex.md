Apex is a **strongly-typed**, **object-oriented** programming language developed by Salesforce for building applications on the Salesforce platform. It is similar to Java and C# in syntax.

The key features of Apex:

- **Hosted**: Apex is saved, compiled, and executed on the serverâ€”the Lightning Platform.
- **Object oriented**: Apex supports classes, interfaces, and inheritance.
- **Strongly typed**: Apex validates references to objects at compile time.
